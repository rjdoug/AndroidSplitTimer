# AndroidSplitTimer
A lot of the time when studying, I would focus on the papers I like most, then when it got to cruch time, my knowledge on my less favorable papers were lacking. So I created
this. Originally it was done un-dynamically in visual studio, last year. It was disgusting, but it did the job. Pretty much, there were 4 slots for papers, in which you'd need to
go into the code to change their names. Each paper had a timer which you could start and stop. You could only run one at a time. At the bottom there would be a total time for
that session. On another page was your log, you could reset it whenever you want. On reset it would store the current date and time and display it as 'last log reset'. Pretty
much this log would count all your times and total time since last reset, so you could get an idea of where you were dedicating your time.

Now my android version has taken leaps an bounds since this original monstrosity. It is now dynamic, so add as many timers as you like. A lot of small issues I had in the original
have been solved. There is still a lot of quality of life changes to be made. My biggest issue is xml and making my elements be more dynamic based on screen size. So my apologies if you have a small screen, you're in for a visually unappealing time. Looks nice on a samsung A50/A5.

Please if you have any ideas, tips or critism, let me know :)
